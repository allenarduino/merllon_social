🧰 Collection—well, just one for now—of helpful utilities and helpers for when
working with React higher-order components (HOC).

I kept copying the same file between multiple packages/repos and it just felt
redundant to have to go about exporting and building a file that was just a copy.
Sorry, but one more npm package lives because of my lazyness.
